# Snort: Powerful Intrusion Detection Tool in Cybersecurity

In the modern digital world, cyber threats are constantly evolving. Organizations need tools that can detect suspicious activity before it turns into a serious attack. One of the most trusted tools used in cybersecurity for this purpose is **Snort**.

Snort is an open-source **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** and **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** that monitors network traffic and identifies potential threats in real time.

## What Is Snort?

Snort is a network security tool that analyzes traffic flowing through a network and checks it against a set of predefined rules. If it detects malicious patterns, it alerts administrators or blocks the traffic, depending on how it is configured.

It is widely used by cybersecurity professionals, enterprises, and security researchers around the world.

## How Snort Works

Snort operates in three main modes:

1. **Sniffer Mode** – Reads network traffic and displays it on the screen.
2. **Packet Logger Mode** – Logs traffic for later analysis.
3. **Network Intrusion Detection Mode** – Monitors traffic and matches it against attack signatures to detect threats.

Snort uses rule sets to identify suspicious activity such as malware communication, port scans, and denial-of-service attacks.

## Key Features of Snort

### 1. Real-Time Traffic Analysis

Snort inspects packets as they travel across the network, allowing immediate detection of threats.

### 2. Signature-Based Detection

It uses a database of known attack patterns to identify malicious activity.

### 3. Protocol Analysis

Snort understands multiple protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, and others.

### 4. Flexible Rule Configuration

Security teams can create custom rules based on their organization’s needs.
